                <p>After the death of his wife Pam, sports anchor Danny Tanner recruits his brother-in-law (Pam's younger brother) Jesse, a rock musician, and his best friend since childhood, Joey, who works as a stand-up comedian, to help raise his three young daughtersâ€”DJ, Stephanie and Michelle. Over time, the three men, as well as the girls, bond and become closer to one another.</p>
